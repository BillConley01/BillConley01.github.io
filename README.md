<h1> Bill Conley's Portfolio Projects</h1>
<h2>Eyes</h2>
<p>This code utilizes mouse events to manipulate DOM element properties causing the eyes to follow the movement of the mouse. This code originate from an assignment in Week #8 of MIT's MERN professional certification program. The challenge was to create a second set of eyes add animate them based on mouse events. Below are a few of its features:</p> 
<ol>
<li>Eyes follow the mouse as it moves across the web page</li>
<li>Added an event listener to observe onmove events</li>
</ol>

<h2>Pacman</h2>
 <p>This code shows a series of Pacman images traversing the web page while opening and closing its mouth (chomping). This code originate from an assignment in Week #7 of MIT's MERN Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to swap images and change direction when page borders are encountered. Below are a few of its features:</p> 
<ol>
<li>A button to add Pacman to the game (more than one can be added)</li>
 <ol>
 <li>Pacman are added at random position</li>
 <li>Pacman move at random speeds</li>
 </ol>
<li>A button to start the game</li>
<li>A game board showing boundaries the Pacman can travel</li>
</ol>
<p>I would like to explore adding the ability to travel up and down when a border is hit, adding paths/level, adding items to the path for the Pacman to collecte, and adding structures to the path that the Pacman would need to maneuver around similar to the old PacMan game</li></p>

<h2>Real Time Bus Tracker</h2>
 <p>This code provides real time location information for four Boston bus lines. This code originate from an assignment in Week #9 of MIT's MERN Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to animate and add features to a map view of a Boston bus route.</p> It utilizes API's from MapBox and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). A feww of the features of this project are:</p>
 <ol>
<li>A selector switch between the views between four different bus routes</li>
<li>Pop up messages with bus information added to each bus marker. (Clicking on the marker opens mesage box)</li>
<li>Custom colors were added to differentiate each bus route</li>
<li>An Alert banner towards bottom of Map for messages</li>
</ol>
